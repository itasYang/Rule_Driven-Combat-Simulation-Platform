# Rule-Driven-Combat-Simulation-Platform
deterministic, rule-driven combat simulation platform with a minimal multiplayer client for validation


This project is a deterministic, rule-driven combat simulation platform.
It is designed to validate complex rule systems, state transitions, and reliability concerns
(such as replayability, session recovery, and idempotent settlement) rather than focusing on gameplay presentation.
***Gameplay is intentionally minimal and serves only as a validation layer for the underlying system design.***
